*Foswiki 1.1.0 and later only*

By default Foswiki stores preferences, including access control settings,
in topics. This means that every time the preferences for a topic are required
- for example, when permissions are being check - it has to be opened and read.
In a typical installation, then the number of topics that have to be read each
time a Foswiki script (or REST request) is run can easily be in the hundreds,
which can be a significant performance hit.

The %TOPIC% uses a Berkeley DB to cache the preference settings read
from topics, so the topics don't have to be repeatedly re-read.

!BerkeleyDB is used because it is reasonably fast, and widely available.
It would be easy for any reasonable programmer to change this to use a different
database technology, if it is preferred. If you do this, please contribute
your solution back to the community.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

Run =configure= and set the ={Store}{PrefsBackend}= setting to
=Foswiki::Prefs::BerkeleyDBRAM=. Visit %SYSTEMWEB%.InstalledPlugins
to check that it is working.

Note that the plugin has no way to detect "offline" topic changes i.e. edits
to topics that are made outside of Foswiki. If offline changes are made, the
only way to repair the database is to delete it, and allow Foswiki to rebuild
it. The database is stored in =/working/PrefsCachePlugin= under the root of your
Foswiki installation, and can be safely deleted at any time.
