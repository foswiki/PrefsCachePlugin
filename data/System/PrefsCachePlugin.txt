*Foswiki 1.1.0 and later only*

By default Foswiki stores preferences, including access control settings,
in topics, either in the text or in %META tags. This means that every time
the preferences for a topic are referenced it has to be opened and parsed,
which can be a significant performance hit.

The %TOPIC% uses a Berkeley DB to cache the preference settings read
from topics, so the topics don't have to be repeatedly re-read. This gives
a small performance boost (~3%) to Foswiki.
